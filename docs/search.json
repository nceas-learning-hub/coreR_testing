    "text": "1 Set up global options in Git\nBefore using Git, you need to tell it who you are, also known as setting the global options. You can do this either on the terminal using git command or in the console using the R package usethis. For this lesson we will use the usethis package. However, you can also find the git commands to reference in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the Terminal?\n\n\n\nTechnically, the Terminal is an interface for the shell, a computer program. To put that simply, we use the Terminal to tell a computer what to do. This is different from the Console in RStudio, which interprets R code and returns a value.\nYou can access the terminal through RStudio by clicking Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New Terminal.\nA Terminal tab should now be open right next to the Console tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t be afraid to dip your toes in the Terminal\n\n\n\nMost of our Git operations will be done in RStudio, but there are some situations where you must work in the Terminal and use command line. It may be daunting to code in the Terminal, but as your comfort increases over time, you might find you prefer it. Either way, it’s beneficial to learn enough command line and to feel comfortable in the Terminal.\n\n\nTo introduce ourselves to git we are going to use the function usethis::use_git_config(), followed by usethis::git_default_branch_configure(). This will update our global options with our GitHub user name and email information.\nBelow you will find code to do this in the console using functions from the usethis package and the terminal using git commands.\nMake sure to type your exact GitHub username and email associated to your GitHub account.\n\nConsoleTerminal\n\n\nStep 1: set the user’s global user.name and user.email and define integrate changes from one branch into another branch for all repositories.\n\n1usethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"my_user_name\",\n2                        user.email = \"my_email@nceas.ucsb.edu\",\n3                        pull.rebase = \"false\")\n\n\n1\n\nAdd you exact same GitHub user name. Case and spelling matters!\n\n2\n\nSet up your email address associated to you GitHub account.\n\n3\n\nSetting “merge” as the default strategy to integrate changes from one branch into another branch (for all repos). Check the note at the end of this chapter for more details.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: define the name of the branch that gets created when you make the first commit in a new Git repo\n\nusethis::git_default_branch_configure(name = \"main\")\n\nStep 3: check to make sure everything looks correct\n\nusethis::git_sitrep()\n\n\n\nStep 1: set the user’s global user.name and user.email and define merge strategy for all repositories.\ngit config --global user.name \"my_user_name\"\nPress enter/return.\nNote that if the code ran successfully, it will look like nothing happened. We will check at the end to make sure it worked.\nThen run:\ngit config --global user.email \"my_email@nceas.ucsb.edu\"\nPress enter/return.\nThen run:\ngit config --global pull.rebase false\nStep 2: define the name of the branch that gets created when you make the first commit in a new Git repo.\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch main\nStep 3: check to make sure everything looks correct.\nThe following command return the global options you have set.\ngit config --global --list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase and spelling matters!\n\n\n\nWhen you add your username and email to the global options you must use the exact same spelling and case that you used on GitHub otherwise, Git won’t be able to sync to your account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy set the default branch name to main?\n\n\n\nPreviously, the default branch name was master and this terminology for Git branches invokes motivates us to update our default branch to main instead.\n\n\n\nSet a long timeout for the git cache\nFinally, we will run a step that is only necessary when working on a server. We need to set our credentials to not time out for a very long time. This is related to how our server operating system handles credentials - not doing this will make your Personal Access Token (PAT, which we will set up in the next section) expire after 15 min on the system, even though it is actually valid for at least a month. We will do this configuration in the terminal.\nYou can access the terminal through RStudio by clicking Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS ONLY NEEDS TO BE RUN ON THE SERVER\n\n\n\nDO NOT RUN THE NEXT LINE when setting up Git and GitHub on your Personal Computer\n\n\nBy running the following command we are asking git to store our credential information in the cache for 10 million seconds (almost 4 months).\ngit config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'",

You can review the scopes, but you don’t need to worry about which ones to select this time. The previous function automatically pre-selects some recommended scopes. Go ahead and scroll to the bottom and click “Generate Token”.\nCopy the generated token.\nBack in RStudio, run gitcreds::gitcreds_set() in the Console.\nPaste your PAT when the prompt asks for it.\nLast thing, run usethis::git_sitrep() in the Console to check your Git configuration and that you’ve successful stored your PAT.

    "section": "1 Welcome to R Programming",
    "text": "1 Welcome to R Programming\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst\n\n\nThere is a vibrant community out there that is collectively developing increasingly easy to use and powerful open source programming tools. The changing landscape of programming is making learning how to code easier than it ever has been. Incorporating programming into analysis workflows not only makes science more efficient, but also more computationally reproducible. In this course, we will use the programming language R, and the accompanying integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio. R is a great language to learn for data-oriented programming because it is widely adopted, user-friendly, and (most importantly) open source!\nSo what is the difference between R and RStudio? Here is an analogy to start us off. If you were a chef, R is a knife. You have food to prepare, and the knife is one of the tools that you’ll use to accomplish your task.\nAnd if R were a knife, RStudio is the kitchen. RStudio provides a place to do your work! RStudio makes your life as a researcher easier by bringing together other tools you need to do your work efficiently - like a file browser, data viewer, help pages, terminal, community, support, the list goes on. So it’s not just the infrastructure (the user interface or IDE), although it is a great way to learn and interact with your variables, files, and interact directly with git. It’s also data science philosophy, R packages, community, and more. Although you can prepare food without a kitchen and we could learn R without RStudio, that’s not what we’re going to do. We are going to take advantage of the great RStudio support, and learn R and RStudio together.\nSomething else to start us off is to mention that you are learning a new language here. It’s an ongoing process, it takes time, you’ll make mistakes, it can be frustrating, but it will be overwhelmingly awesome in the long run. We all speak at least one language; it’s a similar process, really. And no matter how fluent you are, you’ll always be learning, you’ll be trying things in new contexts, learning words that mean the same as others, etc, just like everybody else. And just like any form of communication, there will be miscommunication that can be frustrating, but hands down we are all better off because of it.\nWhile language is a familiar concept, programming languages are in a different context from spoken languages and you will understand this context with time. For example: you have a concept that there is a first meal of the day, and there is a name for that: in English it’s “breakfast.” So if you’re learning Spanish, you could expect there is a word for this concept of a first meal. (And you’d be right: “desayuno”). We will get you to expect that programming languages also have words (called functions in R) for concepts as well. You’ll soon expect that there is a way to order values numerically. Or alphabetically. Or search for patterns in text. Or calculate the median. Or reorganize columns to rows. Or subset exactly what you want. We will get you to increase your expectations and learn to ask and find what you’re looking for.",

    "text": "3 Coding in the Console\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut first, an important first question: where are we?\n\n\n\nIf you’ve just opened RStudio for the first time, you’ll be in your Home directory. This is noted by the ~/ at the top of the console. You can see too that the Files pane in the lower right shows what is in the Home directory where you are. You can navigate around within that Files pane and explore, but note that you won’t change where you are: even as you click through you’ll still be Home: ~/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can run code in a couple of places in RStudio, including the Console, let’s start there.\nAt it’s most basic, we can use R as a calculator, let’s try a couple of examples in the console.\n\n# run in the console\n# really basic examples\n3*4\n3+4\n3-4\n3/4\n\nWhile there are many cases where it makes sense to type code directly in to the the console, it is not a great place to write most of your code since you can’t save what you ran. A better way is to create an R Script, and write your code there. Then when you run your code from the script, you can save it when you are done. We’re going to continue writing code in the Console for now, but we’ll code in an R Script later in this lesson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Tip\n\n\n\nWhen you’re in the console you’ll see a greater than sign (&gt;) at the start of a line. This is called the “prompt” and when we see it, it means R is ready to accept commands. If you see a plus sign (+) in the Console, it means R is waiting on additional information before running. You can always press escape (esc) to return to the prompt. Try practicing this by running 3* (or any incomplete expression) in the console.\n\n\n\n3.1 Objects in R\nLet’s say the value of 12 that we got from running 3*4 is a really important value we need to keep. To keep information in R, we need to create an object. The way information is stored in R is through objects.\nWe can assign a value of a mathematical operation (and more!) to an object in R using the assignment operator, &lt;- (greater than sign and minus sign). All objects in R are created using the assignment operator, following this form: object_name &lt;- value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an object!\nAssign 3*4 to an object called important_value and then inspect the object you just created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# think of this code as someone saying \"important_value gets 12\".\nimportant_value &lt;- 3*4\n\nNotice how after creating the object, R doesn’t print anything. However, we know our code worked because we see the object, and the value we wanted to store is now visible in our Global Environment. We can force R to print the value of the object by calling the object name (aka typing it out) or by using parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Tip\n\n\n\nWhen you begin typing an object name RStudio will automatically show suggested completions for you that you can select by hitting tab, then press return.\n\n\n\n# printing the object by calling the object name\nimportant_value\n\n[1] 12\n\n# printing the object by wrapping the assignment syntax in parentheses\n(important_value &lt;- 3*4)\n\n[1] 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Tip\n\n\n\nWhen you’re in the Console use the up and down arrow keys to call your command history, with the most recent commands being shown first.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Naming Conventions\nBefore we run more calculations, let’s talk about naming objects. For the object, important_value we used an underscore to separate the object name. This naming convention is called snake case. There are other naming conventions including, but not limited to:\n\nwe_used_snake_case\nsomeUseCamelCase\nSomeUseUpperCamelCaseAlsoCalledPascalCase\n\nChoosing a naming convention is a personal preference, but once you choose one - be consistent! A consistent naming convention will increase the readability of your code for others and your future self.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Tip\n\n\n\nObject names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain characters such as a comma or a space.",

    "text": "4 Running code in an R Script\nSo far we’ve been running code in the Console, let’s try running code in an R Script. An R Script is a simple text file. RStudio uses an R Script by copying R commands from text in the file and pastes them into the Console as if you were manually entering commands yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating an R Script\n\n\n\n\nFrom the “File” menu, select “New File”\nClick “R Script” from the list of options\n\nRStudio should open your R Script automatically after creating it. Notice a new pane appears above the Console. This is called the Source pane and is where we write and edit R code and documents. This pane is only present if there are files open in the editor.\n\nSave the R Script in your script folder, name the file intro-to-programming.R\n\n\n\n\n4.1 How to run code in an R Script\nRunning code in an R Script is different than running code in the Console (aka you can’t just press return / enter). To interpret and run the code you’ve written, R needs you to send the code from the script (or editor) to the Console. Some common ways to run code in an R Script include:\n\nPlace your cursor on the line of code you want to run and use the shortcut command + return or click the Run button in the top right of the Source pane.\nHighlight the code you want to run, then use the shortcut command + return or click the Run button.\n\n\n\n4.2 R calculations with objects\nSo we know that objects are how R stores information, and we know we create objects using the assignment operator &lt;-. Let’s build upon that and learn how to use an object in calculations.\nImagine we have the weight of a dog in kilograms. Create the object weight_kg and assign it a value of 25.\n\n# weight of a dog in kilograms\nweight_kg &lt;- 25\n\nNow that R has weight_kg saved in the Global Environment, we can run calculations with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing weight_kg run a simple calculation\nLet’s convert the weight into pounds. Weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# converting weight from kilograms to pounds\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also store more than one value in a single object. Storing a series of weights in a single object is a convenient way to perform the same operation on multiple values at the same time. One way to create such an object is with the function c(), which stands for combine or concatenate.\nFirst let’s create a vector of weights in kilograms using c() (we’ll talk more about vectors in the next section, Data structures in R).\n\n# create a vector of weights in kilograms\nweight_kg &lt;- c(25, 33, 12)\n# call the object to inspect\nweight_kg\n\n[1] 25 33 12\n\n\nNow convert the vector weight_kg to pounds.\n\n# covert `weight_kg` to pounds \nweight_kg * 2.2\n\n[1] 55.0 72.6 26.4\n\n\nWouldn’t it be helpful if we could save these new weight values we just converted? This might be important information we may need for a future calculation. How would you save these new weights in pounds?\n\n# create a new object \nweight_lb &lt;- weight_kg * 2.2\n# call `weight_lb` to check if the information you expect is there\nweight_lb\n\n[1] 55.0 72.6 26.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Tip\n\n\n\nYou will make many objects and the assignment operator &lt;- can be tedious to type over and over. Instead, use RStudio’s keyboard shortcut: option + - (the minus sign).\nNotice that RStudio automatically surrounds &lt;- with spaces, which demonstrates a useful code formatting practice. Code is miserable to read on a good day. Give your eyes a break and use spaces.\nRStudio offers many handy keyboard shortcuts. Also, option+Shift+K brings up a keyboard shortcut reference card.\nFor more RStudio tips, check out Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) workshop: IDE Tips & Tricks.",

You can work with strings in your data in R easily thanks to the stringr and tidytext packages.\nThis lead us to an important concept in programming: As we now know, there are different “classes” or types of objects in R. The operations you can do with an object will depend on what type of object it is because each object has their own specialized format, designed for a specific purpose. This makes sense! Just like you wouldn’t do certain things with your car (like use it to eat soup), you won’t do certain operations with character objects (strings).\nAlso, everything in R is an object. An object is a variable, function, data structure, or method that you have written to your environment.\nTry running the following line in your script:\n\n\"Hello world!\" * 3\n\nWhat happened? What do you see in the Console? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Tip\n\n\n\nYou can see what data type or class an object is using the class() function, or you can use a logical test such as: is.numeric(), is.character(), is.logical(), and so on.\n\nclass(science_rocks) # returns character\nis.numeric(science_rocks) # returns FALSE\nis.character(science_rocks) # returns TRUE",

We often say that we are “calling” a function when it is executed. Functions can be user defined and saved to an object using the assignment operator, so you can write whatever functions you need, but R also has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions ready to use. To start, we will be using some built in R functions.\nAll functions are called using the same syntax: function name with parentheses around what the function needs in order to do what it was built to do. These “needs” are pieces of information called arguments, and are required to return an expected value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax of a function will look something like:\n\n\n\nresult_value &lt;- function_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...)\n\n\nBefore we use a function, let’s talk about Help pages.",

Is that the value you expected? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps you expected mean_weight_lb to change when you changed weight_lb? It did not! This demonstrates an important R programming concept: Assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we understand why the object’s value hasn’t changed - how do we update the value of mean_weight_lb? How is an R Script useful for this?\nThis lead us to another important programming concept, specifically for R Scripts: An R Script runs top to bottom.\nThis order of operations is important because if you are running code line by line, the values in object may be unexpected. When you are done writing your code in an R Script, it’s good practice to clear your Global Environment and use the Run button and select “Run all” to test that your R Script successfully runs top to bottom.\n\n\n9.2 Use the read.csv() function to read a file into R\nSo far we have learned how to assign values to objects in R, and what a function is, but we haven’t quite put it all together yet with real data yet. To do this, we will introduce the function read.csv(), which will be in the first lines of many of your future scripts. It does exactly what it says, it reads in a csv file to R.\nSince this is our first time using this function, first access the help page for read.csv(). This has a lot of information in it, as this function has a lot of arguments, and the first one is especially important - we have to tell it what file to look for. Let’s get a file!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload a file from the Arctic Data Center\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to this dataset by Craig Tweedie that is published on the Arctic Data Center. Craig Tweedie. 2009. North Pole Environmental Observatory Bottle Chemistry. Arctic Data Center. doi:10.18739/A25T3FZ8X.\nDownload the first csv file called BGchem2008data.csv by clicking the “download” button next to the file.\nClick the “Upload” button in your RStudio server file browser.\nIn the dialog box, make sure the destination directory is the data directory in your R project, click “Choose File,” and locate the BGchem2008data.csv file. Press “OK” to upload the file.\nCheck your file was successfully uploaded by navigating into your data folder in the Files pane.\n\n\n\nNow we have to tell read.csv() how to find the file. We do this using the file argument which you can see in the usage section in the help page. In R, you can either use absolute paths (which will start with your home directory ~/) or paths relative to your current working directory. RStudio has some great auto-complete capabilities when using relative paths, so we will go that route.\nAssuming you have moved your file to a folder within training_{USERNAME} called data, and your working directory is your project directory (training_{USERNAME}) your read.csv() call will look like this:\n\n# reading in data using relative paths\nbg_chem_dat &lt;- read.csv(file = \"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")\n\nYou should now have an object of the class data.frame in your environment called bg_chem_dat. Check your environment pane to ensure this is true. Or you can check the class using the function class() in the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Arguments\n\n\n\nNotice that in the Help page there are many arguments that we didn’t use in the call above. Some of the arguments in function calls are optional, and some are required.\nOptional arguments will be shown in the usage section with a name = value pair, with the default value shown. If you do not specify a name = value pair for that argument in your function call, the function will assume the default value (example: header = TRUE for read.csv()).\nRequired arguments will only show the name of the argument, without a value. Note that the only required argument for read.csv() is file.\n\n\nYou can always specify arguments in name = value form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want file = \"data/BGchem2008data.csv\", since file is the first argument.\nIf we explicitly called the file argument our code would like this:\n\nbg_chem_dat &lt;- read.csv(file = \"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")\n\nIf we wanted to add another argument, say stringsAsFactors, we need to specify it explicitly using the name = value pair, since the second argument is header.\nMany R users (including myself) will set the stringsAsFactors argument using the following call:\n\n# relative file path\nbg_chem_dat &lt;- read.csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Tip\n\n\n\nFor functions that are used often, you’ll see many programmers will write code that does not explicitly call the first or second argument of a function.",

    "text": "10 Working with data frames in R using the Subset Operator $\nA data.frame is a list data structure in R that can represent tables and spreadsheets – we can think of it as a table. It is a collection of rows and columns of data, where each column has a name and represents a variable, and each row represents an observation containing a measurement of that variable. When we ran read.csv(), the object bg_chem_dat that we created was a data.frame. The columns in a data.frame might represent measured numeric response values (e.g., weight_kg), classifier variables (e.g., site_name), or categorical response variables (e.g., course_satisfaction). There are many ways R and RStudio help you explore data frames. Here are a few, give them each a try:\n\nClick on the word bg_chem_dat in the environment pane\nClick on the arrow next to bg_chem_dat in the environment pane\nExecute head(bg_chem_dat) in the Console\nExecute View(bg_chem_dat) in the Console\n\nUsually we will want to run functions on individual columns in a data.frame. To call a specific column, we use the list subset operator $.\nSay you want to look at the first few rows of the Date column only:\n\nhead(bg_chem_dat$Date)\n\nYou can also use the subset operator $ calculations. For example, let’s calculated the mean temperature of all the CTD samples.\n\nmean(bg_chem_dat$CTD_Temperature)\n\nYou can also save this calculation to an object that was created using the subset operator $.\n\nmean_temp &lt;- mean(bg_chem_dat$CTD_Temperature)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther ways to load tablular data\n\n\n\nWhile the base R package provides read.csv as a common way to load tabular data from text files, there are many other ways that can be convenient and will also produce a data.frame as output.

There are times you aren’t understood – it’s going to happen. There are different ways this can happen. Sometimes you’ll get an error. This is like someone saying ‘What?’ or ‘Pardon’? Error messages can also be more useful, like when they say ‘I didn’t understand this specific part of what you said, I was expecting something else’. That is a great type of error message. Error messages are your friend. Google them (copy-and-paste!) to figure out what they mean.

    "section": "1 Introduction to Literate Programming",
    "text": "1 Introduction to Literate Programming\nAll too often, computational methods are written in such a way as to be borderline incomprehensible even to the person who originally wrote the code! The reason for this is obvious, computers interpret information very differently than people do. In 1984, Donald Knuth proposed a reversal of the programming paradigm by introducing the concept of Literate Programming (Knuth 1984).\n\n“Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.”\n\nIf our aim is to make scientific research more transparent, the appeal of this paradigm reversal is immediately apparent. By switching to a literate analysis model, you help enable human understanding of what the computer is doing. As Knuth describes, in the literate analysis model, the author is an “essayist” who chooses variable names carefully, explains what they mean, and introduces concepts in the analysis in a way that facilitates understanding.\nQuarto and RMarkdown are an excellent way to generate literate analysis, and a reproducible workflow. These types of files, combine R the programming language, and markdown, a set of text formatting directives.\nIn an R script, the language assumes that you are writing R code, unless you specify that you are writing prose (using a comment, designated by #). The paradigm shift of literate analysis comes in the switch to RMarkdown or Quarto, where instead of assuming you are writing code, they assume that you are writing prose unless you specify that you are writing code. This, along with the formatting provided by markdown, encourages the “essayist” to write understandable prose to accompany the code that explains to the human-beings reading the document what the author told the computer to do. This is in contrast to writing just R code, where the author telling to the computer what to do with maybe a smattering of terse comments explaining the code to a reader.\nBefore we dive in deeper, let’s look at an example of what a rendered literate analysis can look like using a real example. Here is an example of an analysis workflow written using RMarkdown. Note that if this analysis would be in Quarto, the render version it would be similar, except for formatting and layout (eg: the default font in Quarto is different).\nThere are a few things to notice about this document, which assembles a set of similar data sources on salmon brood tables with different formatting into a single data source.\n\nIt introduces the data sources using in-line images, links, interactive tables, and interactive maps.\nAn example of data formatting from one source using R is shown.\nThe document executes a set of formatting scripts in a directory to generate a single merged file.\nSome simple quality checks are performed (and their output shown) on the merged data.\nSimple analysis and plots are shown.\n\nIn addition to achieving literate analysis, this document also represents a reproducible analysis. Because the entire merging and quality control of the data is done using the R code in the Quarto file, if a new data source and formatting script are added, the document can be run all at once with a single click to re-generate the quality control, plots, and analysis of the updated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on reproducibility\n\n\n\nReproducible analysis allow you to automatize how the figures and the statistics in your analysis are generated. This process also helps your collaborators, your readers and your future self to follow your code trail the leads to the original data, increasing the transparency of your science.\nLiterate analysis help reduce the mistakes from copying and pasting across software, keeps results and models in sync, and allows you to provide interested readers with more information about the different approaches and analyses you tried before coming up with the final results (British Ecological Society (2017)).",

    "text": "2 RMarkdown and Quarto\nYou can identify a Quarto file with the .qmd extension. On the other hand, an RMarkdown file has a .Rmd extension. Both have similar structures and both combine prose with code.Quarto provides a rich support to languages other than R such as Python, Observable, and Julia. It also excels in formatting and layout. Allowing users to customize in details the looks of the rendered documents. On the other hand, RMarkdown is compatible with some languages that Quarto is not, for example bash. Quarto and Rmarkdown are amazing tools to use for collaborative research. During this course e will spend some time learning and using the basics of Quarto and provide some comparisons to RMarkdown.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the structure of each of these files. The both look for the most part the same with minor differences.\n\n\nFinally, lets compare each of these files when knitted/rendered.\n\n\nAgain, we see similar outcomes, with minor differences mainly in formatting (font, style of showing code chunks, etc.)\nBoth type of documents have three main components:\n\nYAML metadata to guide the document’s build process\nCode chunks to run\nProse (Text to display)\n\nToday we are going to use Quarto to run some analysis on data. We are specifically going to focus on the code chunk and text components. We will discuss more about the how the YAML works in an Quarto later in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe YAML\n\n\n\nIs the document’s metadata which sets guidelines on how your want the output of your document to look like. It is located at the top of your file, delineated by three dashes (---) at the top and at the bottom of it. It can be used to specify:\n\nCharacteristics of your documents such at title, author, date of creation.\nArgument to pass on the building process to control the format of the output.\nAdd additional information such as the bibliography file (and formatting of the references)\nSpecific parameters for your report (eg: just used a subset of the data).",

    "text": "3 A Quarto Document\nLet’s open an Quarto file following the instructions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n\n\nOpen a new Quarto file using the following prompts: File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document\nA popup window will appear.\nGive your file a new title, e.g “Introduction to Quarto”.\nLeave the output format as HTML and Engine set to Knitr.\nThen click the “Create” button.\n\n\n\nThe first thing to notice is that by opening a file, we see the fourth pane of the RStudio pops up. This is our Quarto document which is essentially a text editor. We also see in the upper left side that we are looking at the document under the “Visual editor”. This is probably a familiar way of looking at a text document. To introduce the markdown syntax, we re going to move to the source editor and then come back to the visual editor. In the upper left corner, click on Source. See how the formatting changed? In the Source editor we are looking at the same text, but in markdown syntax. The visual editor on the other hand, allows us to see how markdown is rendered, therefore how is it going to look in our output document.\nLet’s have a look at this file — As we saw in the examples above, it looks a little different than a R script. It’s not blank; there is some initial text already provided for you. Lets identify the three main components we introduces before. We have the YAML a the top, in between the two sets of dashed lines. Then we also see white and grey sections. The gray sections are R code chunks and the white sections are plain text.\nLet’s go ahead and render this file by clicking the “Render” button, next to the blue arrow at the top of the Quarto file. When you first click this button, RStudio will prompt you to save this file. Save it in into your scripts folder, and name it something that you will remember (like quarto-intro.Rmd).\n\n\n\nWhat do you notice between the two?\nFirst, the render process produced a second file (an HTML file) that popped up in a second window in the browser. You’ll also see this file in your directory with the same name as your qmd, but with the .html extension. In it’s simplest format, Quarto files come in pairs (same than RMarkdown files) the Quarto document, and its rendered version. In this case, we are rendering, the file into HTML. You can also knit to PDF or Word files and others.\nNotice how the grey R code chunks are surrounded by 3 back-ticks and {r LABEL}. The first chunk, in this case 1+1, is evaluated and return the output number (2). Notice the line in the second chunk that says #| echo: false? This is a code chunk option that indicates not to print the code. In the rendered version, we can see the outcome of 2*2 but not the executed code that created the outcome.\nThe table below show some of the options available to customizing outputs (Quarto.org).\n\nCode chunk options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n#| eval:\nEvaluate the code chunk (if false, just echos the code into the output).\n\n\n#| echo:\nInclude the source code in output\n\n\n#| warning:\nInclude warnings in the output.\n\n\n#| error:\nInclude warnings in the output.\n\n\n#| include:\nCatch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g.include: false suppresses all output from the code block).\n\n\n\nNote that you can also combine these options by adding more than one to a code chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOne important difference between Quarto documents and RMarkdown documents is that in Quarto, chunk options are written in special comment format (#|) at the top of code chunks rather than within the wiggly brackets next to ```{r} at the begging of the chunk. For example:\n\nQuarto code options syntax\n\n\n\nRMarkdown code options syntax\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to emphasize one more time that in an Quarto (and RMarkdown) document, the gray areas of the document are code, in this case R code because that is what it is indicated in the ```{r} syntax at the start of this gray area. And the white areas of a qmd are in markdown language.",

Markdown is a formatting language for plain text, and there are only around 15 rules to know.\nNotice the syntax in the document we just knitted:\n\nHeaders get rendered at multiple levels: #, ##\nBold: **word**\n\nThere are some good cheatsheets to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio: Go to Help &gt; Markdown Quick Reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe hash symbol # is used differently in markdown and in R\n\nIn an R script or inside an R code chunk, a hash indicates a comment that will not be evaluated. You can use as many as you want: # is equivalent to ######. It’s just a matter of style.\nIn markdown, a hash indicates a level of a header. And the number you use matters: # is a “level one header”, meaning the biggest font and the top of the hierarchy. ### is a level three header, and will show up nested below the # and ## headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nIn markdown, Write some italic text, make a numbered list, and add a few sub-headers.

    "section": "5 The Visual Editor",
    "text": "5 The Visual Editor\nQuarto has a “what you see is what you mean” (WYSIWYM) editor or Visual editor, which can be a nice way to write markdown without remembering all of the markdown rules. Since there aren’t many rules for markdown, we recommend just learning them especially since markdown is used in many, many other contexts besides Quarto and RMarkdown. For example, formatting GitHub comments and README files.\nTo access the editor, click the Visual button in the upper left hand corner of your editor pane. You’ll notice that your document is now formatted as you type, and you can change elements of the formatting using the row of icons in the top of the editor pane. Although we don’t really recommend doing all of your markdown composition in the Visual editor, there are two features to this editor that we believe are immensely helpful, adding citations, and adding tables.\n\n5.1 Adding citations\nTo add a citation, go to the visual editor and in the insert drop down, select “Citation.” In the window that appears, there are several options in the left hand panel for the source of your citation. If you have a citation manager, such as Zotero, installed, this would be included in that list. For now, select “From DOI”, and in the search bar enter a DOI of your choice (e.g.: 10.1038/s41467-020-17726-z), then select “Insert.”\n\nAfter selecting insert, a couple of things happen. First, the citation reference is inserted into your markdown text as [@oke2020]. Second, a file called references.bib containing the BibTex format of the citation is created. Third, that file is added to the YAML header of your Quarto document (bibliography: references.bib). Adding another citation will automatically update your references.bib file. So easy!\n\n\n5.2 Adding table in markdown\nThe second task that the visual editor is convenient for is generating tables. Markdown tables are a bit finicky and annoying to type, and there are a number of formatting options that are difficult to remember if you don’t use them often. In the top icon bar, the “Table” drop down gives several options for inserting, editing, and formatting tables. Experiment with this menu to insert a small table.",

    "text": "7 Practice: Literate Analysis with ocean water samples\nNow that we have gone over the basics, let’s go a little deeper by building a simple, Quarto document that represents a literate analysis using real data. We are going to work with the seawater chemistry data. We are going to use the BGchem2008data.csv data we downloaded in our previous session.\n\n\n7.1 Getting Started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperienced R users who have never used Quarto (or RMarkdown) often struggle a bit in the transition to developing analysis in Prose+Code format — which makes sense! It is switching the code paradigm to a new way of thinking.\nRather than starting an R chunk and putting all of your code in that single chunk, below we describe what we think is a better way.\n\nOpen a document and block out the high-level sections you know you’ll need to include using top level headers.\nAdd bullet points for some high level pseudo-code steps you know you’ll need to take.\nStart filling in under each bullet point the code that accomplishes each step. As you write your code, transform your bullet points into prose, and add new bullet points or sections as needed.\n\nFor this mini-analysis, we will have the following sections and code steps:\n\nIntroduction\n\nAbout the data\nSetup\nRead in data\n\nAnalysis\n\nCalculate summary statistics\nCalculate mean Redfield ratio\nPlot Redfield ratio\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nUnder “About the data”, write a sentence saying where the data set came from, including a hyperlink ti the data. Also mention when was the data downloaded.\nHint: Navigate to Help &gt; Markdown Quick Reference to look-up the hyperlink syntax.\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Read in the data\nNow that we have outlined our document, we can start writing code! To read the data into our environment, we will use a function from the readr package.\nTo use a package in our analysis, we need to first make sure it is installed (you can install a package by running install.package(\"name-of-package\")). Once installed you need to load it into our environment using library(package_name). Even though we have installed it, we haven’t yet told our R session to access it. Because there are so many packages (many with conflicting namespaces) R cannot automatically load every single package you have installed. Instead, you load only the ones you need for a particular analysis. Loading the package is a key part of the reproducible aspect of our literate analysis, so we will include it as an R chunk as part of our Setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Practice\n\n\n\nIt is generally good practice to include all of your library() calls in a single, dedicated R chunk near the top of your document. This lets collaborators know what packages they might need to install before they start running your code.\n\n\nThe server should have already installed the two packages we need for now: readr and here. Let’s add a new R chunk below your Setup header that calls these libraries, and run it.\nIt should look like this:\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto file path and the here() function\n\n\n\nQuarto has a special way of handling relative paths that can be very handy. When working in an Quarto document, R will set all paths relative to the location of the Quarto file. This can make things easier to read in data if your Quarto document is stored in the same directory or “near” by. However, more often that not, your .qmd file will be stored in a a folder (e.g scripts) and your data in a data folder, (both folder in the main project directory).\nThe here() function helps navigate this file path mix up in a straight forward and reproducible way. This function sets the file path to the project’s directory and builds the rest of the file path from there. Making it easier to find files inside different folders in a project. In this case, because the .qmd file lives in the script folder, here() makes is easy to navigate back into the project’s directory and then into the data folder to read in our file.\n\n\nNow, under “Read data”, add a code chunk that uses the read_csv() with the here() function to read in your data file.\n\n\nRows: 70 Columns: 19\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (1): Station\ndbl  (16): Latitude, Longitude, Target_Depth, CTD_Depth, CTD_Salinity, CTD_T...\ndttm  (1): Time\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\nbg_chem &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\"))\n\n\n\nWhy read_csv() over read.csv()?\nWe chose to show read_csv() from the readr package to introduce the concept of packages, to show you how to load packages, and read_csv() has several advantages over read.csv() from base R, including:\n\nMore reasonable function defaults (no stringsAsFactors!)\nSmarter column type parsing, especially for dates\nread_csv() is much faster than read.csv(), which is helpful for large files\n\nOnce you run this line in your document, you should see the bg_chem object populate in your environment pane. It also spits out lots of text explaining what types the function parsed each column into. This text is important, and should be examined, but we might not want it in our final document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nHow would you suppress the warnings (so they don’t show in our output file) form a specific code chunk?\nHint: Code chunk options\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Calculate Summary Statistics\nAs our “analysis” we are going to calculate some very simple summary statistics and generate a single plot. Using water samples from the Arctic Ocean, we will examine the ratio of nitrogen to phosphate to see how closely the data match the Redfield ratio, which is the consistent 16:1 ratio of nitrogen to phosphorous atoms found in marine phytoplankton.\nLet’s start by exploring the data we just read. Every time we read a new data set, it is important to familiarize yourself with it and make sure that the data looks as expected. Below some useful functions for exploring your data.\nLet’s start by creating a new R chunk and run the following functions. Because this just an exploration and we do not want this chunk to be part of our report, we will indicate that by adding #|eval: false and #| echo: false in the setup of the chunk, that way, the code in this chunk will not run and not be displayed when I knit the final document.\n\n## Prints the column names of my data frame\ncolnames(bg_chem)\n\n## General structure of the data frame - shows class of each column\nstr(bg_chem)\n\n## First 6 lines of the data frame\nhead(bg_chem)\n\n## Summary of each column of data\nsummary(bg_chem)\n\n## Prints unique values in a column (in this case Date)\nunique(bg_chem$Date)\n\nTo peek out data frame, we can type View(bg_chem) in the console. This will open a tab with our data frame in a tabular format.\nNow that we know a more about the data set we are working with lets do some analyses. Under the appropriate bullet point in your analysis section, create a new R chunk, and use it to calculate the mean nitrate (NO3), nitrite (NO2), ammonium (NH4), and phosphorous (P) measured.\nSave these mean values as new variables with easily understandable names, and write a (brief) description of your operation using markdown above the chunk. Remember that the $ (aka the subset operator) indicates which column of your data to look into.\n\nnitrate &lt;- mean(bg_chem$NO3)\nnitrite &lt;- mean(bg_chem$NO2)\namm &lt;- mean(bg_chem$NH4)\nphos &lt;- mean(bg_chem$P)\n\nIn another chunk, use those variables to calculate the nitrogen: phosphate ratio (Redfield ratio).\n\nratio &lt;- (nitrate + nitrite + amm)/phos\n\nYou can access this variable in your markdown text by using R in-line in your text. The syntax to call R in-line (as opposed to as a chunk) is a single back tick `, followed by the letter “r”, then whatever your simple R command is — here we will use round(ratio) to print the calculated ratio, and finally a closing back tick `. This allows us to access the value stored in this variable in our explanatory text without resorting to the evaluate-copy-paste method so commonly used for this type of task.\nSo, the text in you Quarto document should look like this:\nThe Redfield ratio for this dataset is approximately: `r round(ratio)`\nAnd the rendered text like this:\nThe Redfield ratio for this dataset is approximately 6.\nFinally, create a simple plot using base R that plots the ratio of the individual measurements, as opposed to looking at mean ratio.\n\nplot(bg_chem$P, bg_chem$NO2 + bg_chem$NO3 + bg_chem$NH4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nDecide whether or not you want the plotting code above to show up in your knitted document along with the plot, and implement your decision as a chunk option.\nRender your Quarto document (by pressing the Render button) and observe the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I decide when to make a new code chunk?\n\n\n\nLike many of life’s great questions, there is no clear cut answer. A rule of thumb is to have one chunk per functional unit of analysis. This functional unit could be 50 lines of code or it could be 1 line, but typically it only does one “thing.” This could be reading in data, making a plot, or defining a function. It could also mean calculating a series of related summary statistics (as we’ll see below). Ultimately, the choice is one related to personal preference and style, but generally you should ensure that code is divided up such that it is easily explainable in a literate analysis as the code is run.",

    "text": "8 Quarto and Environments\nLet’s walk through an exercise with the document we just created to demonstrate how Quarto handles environments. We will be deliberately inducing some errors here for demonstration purposes.\nFirst, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\n\n\nRestart your R session (Session &gt; Restart R)\nRun the last chunk in your Quarto document by pressing the play button on the chunk\n\n\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, we get an error:\nError in plot(bg_chem$P, bg_chem$NO2 + bg_chem$NO3 + bg_chem$NH4) : \n  object 'bg_chem' not found\nThis is because we have not run the chunk of code that reads in the bg_chem data. The R part of Quarto works just like a regular R script. You have to execute the code, and the order that you run it in matters. It is relatively easy to get mixed up in a large Quarto document — running chunks out of order, or forgetting to run chunks.\nTo resolve this, follow the next step:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup continued\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the “Run” menu (top right of the editor pane) “Run All.”\nObserve the bg_chem variable in your environment\n\n\n\nThis is a great way to reset and re-run code when things seem to have gone sideways. It is great practice to do periodically since it helps ensure you are writing code that actually runs and it’s reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the next exercise:\n\n\n\n\nClean your environment by clicking the broom in the environment pane\nRestart your R session (Session &gt; Restart R)\nPress “Render” to run all of the code in your document\nObserve the state of your environment pane\n\nAssuming your document rendered and produced an html page, your code ran. Yet, the environment pane is empty. What happened?\n\n\nThe Render button is rather special — it doesn’t just run all of the code in your document. It actually spins up a fresh R environment separate from the one you have been working in, runs all of the code in your document, generates the output, and then closes the environment. This is one of the best ways Quarto (or RMarkdown) helps ensure you have built a reproducible workflow. If, while you were developing your code, you ran a line in the console as opposed to adding it to your Quarto document, the code you develop while working actively in your environment will still work. However, when you knit your document, the environment RStudio spins up doesn’t know anything about that working environment you were in. Thus, your code may error because it doesn’t have that extra piece of information. Commonly, library() calls are the source of this kind of frustration when the author runs it in the console, but forgets to add it to the script.\nTo further clarify the point on environments, perform the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup continued\n\n\n\n\nSelect from the “Run” menu (top right of editor pane) “Run All”\nObserve all of the variables in your environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about all my R Scripts?\n\n\n\nSome pieces of R code are better suited for R scripts than Quarto or RMarkdown. A function you wrote yourself that you use in many different analyses is probably better to define in an R script than repeated across many Quarto or RMarkdown documents. Some analyses have mundane or repetitive tasks that don’t need to be explained very much. For example, in the document shown in the beginning of this lesson, 15 different excel files needed to be reformatted in slightly different, mundane ways, like renaming columns and removing header text. Instead of including these tasks in the primary Quarto document, the authors chose to write one R script per file and stored them all in a directory. Then, took the contents of one script and included it in the literate analysis, using it as an example to explain what the scripts did, and then used the source() function to run them all from within the Quarto document.\nSo, just because you know Quarto now, doesn’t mean you won’t be using R scripts anymore. Both .R and .qmd have their roles to play in analysis. With practice, it will become more clear what works well in Quarto or RMarkdown, and what belongs in a regular R script.",

We will be using a special kind of RStudio just for servers called RStudio Server. If you have never worked on a remote server before, you can think of it like working on a different computer via the internet. Note that the server has no knowledge of the files on your local filesystem, but it is easy to transfer files from the server to your local computer, and vice-versa, using the RStudio server interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer Setup\n\n\n\nYou should have received an email prompting you to change your password for your server account. If you did not, please put up a post-it and someone will help you.\nAfter you have successfully changed your password log in at: https://included-crab.nceas.ucsb.edu/",

    "text": "2 Create an R Project\nIn this course, we are going to be using an R project to organize our work. An R project is tied to a directory on your local computer, and makes organizing your work and collaborating with others easier.\nThe Big Idea: using an R project is a reproducible research best practice because it bundles all your work within a working directory. Consider your current data analysis workflow. Where do you import you data? Where do you clean and wrangle it? Where do you create graphs, and ultimately, a final report? Are you going back and forth between multiple software tools like Microsoft Excel, JMP, and Google Docs? An R project and the tools in R that we will talk about today will consolidate this process because it can all be done (and updated) in using one software tool, RStudio, and within one R project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Project Setup\n\n\n\n\nIn the “File” menu, select “New Project”\nClick “New Directory”\nClick “New Project”\nUnder “Directory name” type: training_{USERNAME} (i.e. training_vargas)\nLeave “Create Project as subdirectory of:” set to ~\nClick “Create Project”\n\nRStudio should open your new project automatically after creating it. One way to check this is by looking at the top right corner and checking for the project name.",

    "text": "3 Organizing an R Project\nWhen starting a new research project, one of the first things I do is create an R Project for it (just like we have here!). The next step is to then populate that project with relevant directories. There are many tools out there that can do this automatically. Some examples are rrtools or usethis::create_package(). The goal is to organize your project so that it is a compendium of your research. This means that the project has all of the digital parts needed to replicate your analysis, like code, figures, the manuscript, and data access.\nSome common directories are:\n\n\n\ndata: where we store our data (often contains subdirectories for raw, processed, and metadata data)\nR: contains scripts with your custom R functions, etc. (some find this name misleading if their work has other scripts beyond the R programming language, in which case they call this directory scripts)\nplots or figs: generated plots, graphs, and figures\ndocs: summaries or reports of analysis or other relevant project information\nscripts: has all scripts where you clean and wrangle data and run your analysis.\n\nDirectory organization will vary from project to project, but the ultimate goal is to create a well organized project for both reproducibility and collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Sub-directories\n\n\n\nFor this week we are going to create 3 folder (directories) in our training_{USERNAME} Rproject.\n\nIn the files pane in RStudio (bottom right), click on Folder button (with a green circle and plus sign) and create 3 new folders: data, plots, scripts.\n\nThe idea here is treat this RProject as an example of how to organize our work.",

    "text": "4 Moving in an R Project using Paths & Working Directories\n\nNow that we have your project created (and notice we know it’s an R Project because we see a .Rproj file in our Files pane), let’s learn how to move in a project. We do this using paths.\nThere are two types of paths in computing: absolute paths and relative paths.\n\nAn absolute path always starts with the root of your file system and locates files from there. The absolute path to my project directory is: /home/vargas-poulsen/training_vargas\nRelative paths start from some location in your file system that is below the root. Relative paths are combined with the path of that location to locate files on your system. R (and some other languages like MATLAB) refer to the location where the relative path starts as our working directory.\n\nRStudio projects automatically set the working directory to the directory of the project. This means that you can reference files from within the project without worrying about where the project directory itself is. If I want to read in a file from the data directory within my project, I can simply type read.csv(\"data/samples.csv\") as opposed to read.csv(\"/home/vargas-poulsen/training_vargas/data/samples.csv\").\nThis is not only convenient for you, but also when working collaboratively. We will talk more about this later, but if Matt makes a copy of my R project that I have published on GitHub, and I am using relative paths, he can run my code exactly as I have written it, without going back and changing /home/vargas-poulsen/training_vargas/data/samples.csv to /home/jones/training_jones/data/samples.csv.\nNote that once you start working in projects you should basically never need to run the setwd() command. If you are in the habit of doing this, stop and take a look at where and why you do it. Could leveraging the working directory concept of R projects eliminate this need? Almost definitely!\nSimilarly, think about how you work with absolute paths. Could you leverage the working directory of your R project to replace these with relative paths and make your code more portable? Probably!",
